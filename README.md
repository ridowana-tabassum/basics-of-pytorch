# PyTorch Overview

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph. It's widely used for building and training deep learning models. PyTorch is known for its ease of use, dynamic computation, and strong support for GPU acceleration.

## Important Components

### Tensors
Tensors are the fundamental building blocks in PyTorch. They are multi-dimensional arrays, similar to NumPy arrays, that can be operated upon with GPU acceleration.

### Autograd
Autograd is PyTorch's automatic differentiation library. It tracks operations on tensors and automatically computes gradients, which is crucial for backpropagation during model training.

### Neural Network Module
PyTorch provides the `torch.nn` module for building neural network layers and models. It includes pre-defined layers, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

### Optimizers
Optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are available in `torch.optim` to update model parameters during training.

### Dataset and DataLoader
`torch.utils.data.Dataset` allows you to create custom datasets, and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` simplifies data loading and batching for training.

## Installation

To get started with PyTorch, follow these steps:

1. Install using `pip` (for CPU version):
pip install torch torchvision

2. For GPU support (if available), install CUDA (NVIDIA GPU required) and then install PyTorch:
pip install torch torchvision

3. Verify the installation: import torch
print(torch.__version__)
